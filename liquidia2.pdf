RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., April 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Liquidia Corporation (NASDAQ: LQDA) announced today that it has entered into a common stock purchase agreement with certain institutional, accredited investors for the private placement of 8,626,037 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $2.52 per share, the closing price per share of common stock on April 12, 2021. The private placement is expected to close today and yield gross proceeds of approximately $21.7 million. The investor group was led by Caligan Partners LP and includes participation by existing directors Paul Manning and Roger Jeffs.

Upon closing, David Johnson, a Partner and Co-Founder of Caligan Partners LP, will be appointed to the board of directors of Liquidia Corporation as a Class II Director and a member of the Audit Committee. Previously, Mr. Johnson worked at The Carlyle Group as Managing Director and at Morgan Stanley as Vice President in the Principal Investments area. Mr. Johnson was previously a director of AMAG Pharmaceuticals.

Stephen Bloch, M.D., Chairman of the Liquidia Board of Directors, said: “Adding David to the Board further strengthens our abilities to navigate financial markets and advise Liquidia with the short and long term in mind. We look forward to bringing his experiences to bear in future discussions.”

David Johnson said: “We are excited to support Liquidia’s commitment to bring novel therapies to market for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  Caligan believes that LIQ861 will be the best inhaled option to treat PAH because of its convenience and ability to safely provide symptomatic relief at higher dosage levels than existing inhaled treprostinil therapies.  We are also excited about Liquidia’s recent announcement that its subcutaneous Treprostinil Injection will soon be available to PAH patients. We have tremendous confidence in Damian deGoa and the Liquidia team to execute on their strategic plan and look forward to working closely with them during their next stage of growth.”

Damian deGoa, Chief Executive Officer of Liquidia, said: “We are fortunate to include David Johnson on the board and to bring smart, committed investors into Liquidia. This financing builds on several steps taken during the last three months to strengthen our balance sheet and position the company for an exciting future.”

Net proceeds from this private placement are expected to strengthen commercial capability for the introduction of LIQ861 and the subcutaneous administration of Treprostinil Injection, enable growth initiatives, and provide support general corporate purposes.

About LIQ861
LIQ861 is an investigational inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed using Liquidia’s PRINT® technology with the goal of enhancing deep-lung delivery using a convenient, palm-sized dry powder inhaler for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PRINT® technology enables the development of drug particles that are precise and uniform in size, shape and composition, and that are engineered for optimal deposition in the lung following oral inhalation. Liquidia believes LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current inhaled therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs. Liquidia has completed an open-label, multi-center phase 3 clinical study of LIQ861 in patients diagnosed with PAH known as INSPIRE, or Investigation of the Safety and Pharmacology of Dry Powder Inhalation of Treprostinil.

About Treprostinil Injection
Treprostinil Injection is the first-to-file, fully substitutable generic treprostinil for parenteral administration. Treprostinil Injection contains the same active ingredient, same strengths, same dosage form and same inactive ingredients as Remodulin® (treprostinil), and is offered to patients and physicians with the same level of service and support, but at a lower price than the branded drug. Liquidia PAH promotes the appropriate use of Treprostinil Injection for the treatment of PAH in the United States in partnership with its commercial partner, who holds the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA.
